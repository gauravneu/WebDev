                Suddenly an explosion of music and lights 
                reveals a larger-than-life junkyard.
                Probing car lights tear across the darkened
                landscape of bottles and boxes, briefly 
                catching the darting image of a running cat. 
                Tonight is the one special night each year 
                when the tribe of Jellicle Cats reunites to 
                celebrate who they are.They emerge singing 
                of their unique abilities and special traits.
                The cats are at first suspicious and proud, 
                reluctant to allow an audience into their domain.
                In The Naming of Cats, however, they begin to 
                reveal themselves and that cats have three
                different names: the one the family uses 
                daily, a more dignified name, and a secret 
                name. It is the contemplation of these secret
                names that keeps felines deep in thought.`,

        The Invitation To The Jellicle Ball. Munkustrap,
        a large grey tabby, explains that the Jellicle 
        Cats meet once a year to rejoice.
        They are waiting for their leader, the wise Old
        Deuteronomy, who will choose which of the Jellicle 
        Cats will journey tonight to the Heaviside layer to
        be reborn into a new life.And so begins our 
        introduction to the cats. One by one they step 
        forward to audition for the role, to be chosen
        to make the special journey to be reborn.Jennyanydots,
        The Old Gumbie Cat, sleeps and lounges all day long;
        Rum Tum Tugger, a playful prankster that the female
        cats find extremely attractive, and who enjoys being
        the centre of attention, Grizabella, The Glamour Cat,
        who is shunned by the rest of the tribe despite being
        a Jellicle Cat and Bustopher Jones, a large “twenty 
        five pounder”, always clad in signature white spats.
        A thunderous crash and the sound of police sirens will
        signal that the villainous Macavity is on the loose 
        and send the Jellicles scattering!`,

        text: `Distant giggles signal the entrance of Mungojerrie
        and Rumpleteazer, a fun-loving, frolicking team 
        of pranksters who are always in trouble with the
        family with whom they live. The entire tribe 
        returns as their benevolent and wise old leader 
        Old Deuteronomy arrives. The cats adore and 
        respect him, indeed he is father to some of them.
        They entertain him with a special show narrated 
        by Munkustrap, The Aweful Battle of the Pekes 
        and the Pollicles together with the The Marching
        Song of the Pollicle Dogs. The cats dress up as
        the two rival dog factions who bark ceaselessly 
        at each other until they are frightened away by 
        the Great Rumpus Cat, a sleek and powerful feline.
        Finally, it is time for The Jellicle Ball, the
        great annual dance in which all the cats celebrate.
        Grizabella appears once more, wanting to rejoin her 
        family and be a part of the celebration. She is left 
        to contemplate her “Memory” of the time before she 
        left the tribe. She stretches out her hand behind 
        her, hoping another cat will touch her. She is 
        still not accepted and, disappointed, slinks off 
        into the night.`,
