            <div class="cardtext">Elephants are the biggest terrestrial animals. They are found mostly in dense
                forests and are always found in groups. The elephants are black in colour with a small tail, two big
                ears, thick legs, a trunk, and two little eyes. The teeth of elephants are very costly and are referred
                to as tusks. Elephants eat twigs, leaves, fruits, etc. and are herbivores. In ancient times people used
                elephants in wars, for lifting heavy logs from grounds, for felling trees, etc.
                Elephants are the strongest and most intelligent animals and are, therefore, very useful to human beings.
