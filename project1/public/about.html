      <div class="span"><span><h2>Fact 1</h2></span>
      <p class="para">Once common throughout Africa and Asia, elephant populations have experienced significant declines over the
        last century. The greatest threat to African elephants is poaching for the illegal ivory trade, while
        Asian elephant populations are most at risk from habitat loss and resulting human-elephant conflict.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="span"><span><h2>Fact 2</h2></span>
        <p class="para">Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long
          trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water
          for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each
          individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear
          and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's
          trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense.
          During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="span"><span><h2>Fact 3</h2></span>
        <p class="para">Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical
          differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped
          ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and female African
          elephants grow tusks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="span"><span><h2>Fact 4</h2></span>
        <p class="para">Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male
          elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female once every
          four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 monthsâ€”the longest of any mammal. Calves are cared for
          by the entire herd of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal herd for the rest of their
          lives, while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest elephants' social groups differ slightly and
          may be comprised of only an adult female and her offspring. However, they may congregate in larger groups
          in forest clearings where resources are more abundant.</p>
